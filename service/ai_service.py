    - If the answer is even partially correct or shows partial understanding, give a higher score (4–5).

    - Never penalize for short answers if they are correct.

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    - DO NOT use "unclear" unless the message is completely meaningless.
    - If the user *tries* to answer (even partially or with errors), classify as "answer".
